Prescripto Frontend is a fully responsive, user–friendly interface designed for an advanced Doctor Appointment Booking Platform. This project is developed using React.js and follows an organized component architecture to ensure reusability, clean code structure, and scalability. The UI is built to support three different user roles: Patients, Doctors, and Admins, each having separate dashboards and functionalities. Although this repository contains only the frontend implementation, it has been developed to integrate seamlessly with backend APIs in a MERN environment.

From a patient’s perspective, this frontend provides pages to explore doctors, view their specialization, book appointments, and manage scheduled bookings. Patients can log in or register through dedicated forms. Once logged in, they can track appointments, update their profile, and interact with a simple dashboard layout built with clean navigation in mind.

Doctors are provided with a separate login UI. After authentication, they land on a dashboard tailored for medical professionals. They can view appointment requests, check patient schedules, monitor earnings (UI representation), and manage their profile details. The design focuses on simplicity to ensure doctors can quickly access the details they need.

For administrators, a dedicated admin dashboard enables UI-level controls for managing doctors and appointment records. The interface layouts include doctor approval screens, appointment overview sections, and admin login access. The structure has been built keeping real–world management systems in mind to reflect professional use cases.
